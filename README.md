===========

Hello world,

I'm a little bit of a noob when it comes to using GitHub but I hope to use it to get involved with some open source projects. I'm a software architect and lead developer with over 10 years experiance of Microsoft development manily using C#. I love building web solutions which have a great userexperiance and I have some experiance of writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

One of the reasons why I wan't to get involved with some open source projects is that I want to expand my horizons and perhaps work with some different technologies. So if you have a Java, Ruby or Python project and you want a hand then maybe I can be of help.

Chris
